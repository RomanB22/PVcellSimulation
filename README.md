In order to run the code, first you need to simulate the spike trains. To do so, go to directory cells/ and run readExpFR.py, changing the variable folder (below the if __name__=='main' line) to the desired condition ('Go' or 'No Go')

Then, you can run the simulations changing the src/cfg.py file to the desired values, and entering on the terminal python src/init.py or src/batch.py if you want to run the batch files
