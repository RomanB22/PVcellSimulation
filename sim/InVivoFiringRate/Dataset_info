There is a text file for each cell which includes the timing of the behavioural events as well.
The data is orders as spike rate, ITI, cue presentation, movement (lever push), and reward delivery.

It includes the inferred spike rate across several concatenated trials, as well as binarized vector
that indicate the ITI, cue presentation, movement (lever push), and reward the delivery. Note the
movement is very fast, so for our analysis "we have used a peri movement period following cue
presentation" and avoiding reward delivery.

The data is sampled at 31 Hz (that means 32.26 ms time windows), and in total I have 47 CSNs with
increased activity and 114 with decreased activity, so please let me know if you’d like me to share
the whole dataset with you.

Another detail I wanted to mention is that the spike rate obtained with the deconvolution algorithm
accounts for relatively high-frequency spike trains that would cause deviations in the deltaF, but
there’s likely an underlying average spike rate that defines a baseline deltaF. Since this would
look like a flat deltaF trace, the deconvolution algorithm assigns a spike rate of 0Hz to these
time periods. We’re not sure how we would account for this (or if it would have a large impact on
the model) but we thought it could be approximated using the patch data Ian has sent you. Please let
me know if this is unclear and I can show you some examples via email or we could organise a call.
